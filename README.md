# ALU
Design of Hardware Generation Tool for ALU

C program file genSV.c contains the source code for the generator.

Use gcc genSV.c -o genSV -lm to compile the code.

Provide the parameters on command line while executing the code.
Ex: ./genSV 8 8 2

The C file generates the following files:

				h_katagal_calc_8_8_2.sv  -- This file contains the SV source code for the design.
				
				h_katagal_calc_tb1_8_8_2.sv -- This is randomized testbench which takes inputs that are generated by another C program.
				
				h_katagal_calc_tb2_8_8_2.sv -- This is a simple testbench to verify the operations of the ALU manually.
				
				testgen_tb1_8_8_2.c -- This C file generates the input vectors and expected results for tb1 testbench.
				
				runsim -- The script to compile and execute the above files. This file first executes the C program to generate input vectors and expected output. Then it 		   compiles and runs the main SV code and tb1 code to test the functionality.
